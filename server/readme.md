2. **Backend**: Implement a backend API that supports the frontend application. The backend should provide endpoints for the following operations:

   - Create a new TODO item.
   - Retrieve a list of TODO items.
   - Update an existing TODO item.
   - Mark a TODO item as completed or incomplete.
   - Delete a TODO item.

3. **Bonus Points:**

   - Implement user authentication to secure the application.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
   - Write unit and/or interaction tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
